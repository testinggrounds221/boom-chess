Can u add the following feature to the boomerang chess:

Normal game syntax:

e4 e5
Qh5 Be7
Qxf7 Kf8

Boomerang game syntax:

e4 e5
Qh5 Be7
Qxf7< Kf8

Here the symbol "<" indicates a boomerang move.
This syntax is easy to use by a human also for recording a boomerang chess game.

The game shud have the following features:

1) Ability to save the game G1 sequence in the above syntax (using the "<" symbol for boomerang moves)

2) Ability to open the saved game sequence G1 and view the game move by move.

3) Ability to save a particular game "position" Pos1.

4) Ability to open a saved position pos1 and continue playing a game.

We need to find a similar manual notation for recording Xray chess and Pool Chess moves , which is useable both by humans and computers.

Let me know ur thoughts.

c.move(c.moves()[Math.floor(Math.random() * c.moves().length)]);
c.move(c.moves()[Math.floor(Math.random() * c.moves().length)])["san"]

to do :
for all illegal moves
for boom move
